## Reolink Camera Utility Scripts

This repository contains different bash scripts and commands for reolink camera.

### Requirements

These scripts use **ffmpeg**, to install it you can:

```bash
apt install ffmpeg    # linux debian-based
brew install ffmpeg   # mac
```

If you are using Windows you can download it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

  <summary>Why ffmpeg?</summary>
  I tried **openRTSP** ❌ but half of the video in the MP4 format is without audio and I don't know why.

example:

```bash
openRTSP -D 1 -c -B 10000000 -b 10000000 -q -Q -F cam_eight -d 28800 -P 10 -t rtsp://"admin":"mypassword"@192.168.0.176:554
```

source of command and explanation: https://superuser.com/questions/766437/capture-rtsp-stream-from-ip-camera-and-store

I tried **VLC** ❌ but I got some issues saving the files with the audio and managing it.

example command:

```bash
cvlc rtsp://admin:password@192.168.0.176:554//h264Preview_01_main --sout=file/ts:mystream.mpg
```

FFmpeg was the best, so I chose it. ✅

### Usage

Download and use the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReolinkCameraAPI/scripts
cd scripts
```

### download.sh

How to use it:

```bash
chmod +x download.sh
./download.sh -u myusername -p mypassowrd -i 192.168.1.197 -t 60 -n 554 -o tmp
```

- `-u` username of your camera
- `-p` password of your camera
- `-i` camera local IP address
- `-t` is the time in seconds that any file will contain (default value 60)
- `-n` is the port (default value 554)
- `-o` output directory path (default `.`, the current directory)

To stop the execution you can type `Ctrl + C`.

This script uses `ffmpeg` to download via RTSP the video and audio from your camera saving it in the MP4 format, the name will start with the `date` of the day (ex. `2022-08-26--22-00-00-capture-0000.mp4`) and a file will be recorded and saved every `$TIME` seconds.  
The name of the files starts with a date to make it easier the management of the files, like removing easily all the records of a specific month, day or year.

### clean_record.sh

```bash
chmod +x clean_record.sh
./clean_record.sh
```

This script deletes all the records inside a `tmp` directory of the previous month.
